## FAQ

### The wavelength coverage of templates is not enough for me

The spectral models used to generate the templates do not always have enough wavelength range coverage, especially in the rest-frame UV.
We are planning to replace them with models with sufficient wavelength coverage, but in the meantime, please provide your own spectra as a custom input.

### No suitable template is available for my science

Please send a request for [us](contact.md). In the meantime, please use a custom input.
